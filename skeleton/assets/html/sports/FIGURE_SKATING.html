                            <p>Figure skating is the oldest sport on the Olympic Winter Games programme. It was contested at the 1908 London Games and again in 1920 in Antwerp. Men's, women's and pairs were the three events contested until 1972. Since 1976, ice dancing has been the fourth event in the programme, proving a great success.</p>
