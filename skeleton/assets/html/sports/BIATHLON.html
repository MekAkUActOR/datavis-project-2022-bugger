              <h4>BIATHLON</h4>
              <p>In 1924 in Chamonix, an ancient form of biathlon made its Olympic debut: the military patrol. This event was then in demonstration in 1928, 1936 and 1948. After some attempts to incorporate it into a winter pentathlon, biathlon appeared at the Games in its current form in 1960 in Squaw Valley. Womenâ€™s biathlon made its first appearance on the Olympic programme in Albertville in 1992.<br><br>Until the 1976 Games in Innsbruck, the events comprised an individual race and a relay. In Lake Placid in 1980, a second individual event was introduced.<br><br>In Salt Lake City in 2002, a 12.5km pursuit event was added for men and 10km for women. From Turin in 2006, a new mass-start event was introduced for both men and women. This brings together the 30 best athletes from the World Cup.</p>
