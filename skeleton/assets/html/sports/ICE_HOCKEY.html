    <h4>ICE HOCKEY</h4>
    <p><br><br>Six-a-side men's ice hockey has been on the programme of every edition of the Winter Games since 1924 in Chamonix. Women's ice hockey was accepted as an Olympic sport in 1992, and made its official debut in 1998 in Nagano.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, Canada dominated the first tournaments. However, in 1956, and until its dissolution, the Soviet Union took over and became the number one team. It was interrupted only by USA victories in 1960 in Squaw Valley and in 1980 in Lake Placid.</p>
