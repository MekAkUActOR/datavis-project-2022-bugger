              <h4>SNOWBOARD</h4>
              <p>Men's and women's snowboarding made their Olympic debuts at the Nagano Games in 1998 with giant slalom and halfpipe competitions. The discipline proved an instant success and returned to Salt Lake City four years later with parallel giant slalom and halfpipe competitions. In Turin, snowboard cross also made its debut. In this event, four riders race across a course studded with jumps, bumps and huge turns. Slopestyle was added for 2014 and Big Air for 2018.</p>
