  <h4>FREESTYLE SKIING</h4>
  <p><br><br>Freestyle skiing was contested as a demonstration sport at the 1988 Calgary Games. There were events for both men and women in all three events: moguls, aerials and ballet. Four years later, the mogul event gained medal status at the Albertville Games, as did the aerial event in Lillehammer in 1994. Ski cross made its Olympic debut at the 2010 Vancouver Games. Slopestyle and halfpipe were added to the freestyle skiing programme at the 2014 Sochi Games.</p>
