  <h4>NORDIC COMBINED</h4>
  <p><br><br>This sport, which has a long Olympic history, combines ski jumping and cross-country skiing.<br><br>Nordic combined individual events have featured in every Games since the first Olympic Winter Games in Chamonix in 1924. Unsurprisingly, the sport has been dominated by the Norwegians, supported by the Finns. Indeed, it was not until 1960 that the Nordic grip on Olympic triumphs in this discipline was finally broken, when West German Georg Thoma won the gold medal at Squaw Valley in 1960.</p>
