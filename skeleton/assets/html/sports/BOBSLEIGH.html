              <h4>BOBSLEIGH</h4>
              <p>In 1924, a four-man race took place at the first ever Olympic Winter Games in Chamonix. A two-man event was added at the 1932 Lake Placid Games in a format that has remained to the present. The first women's bobsleigh event, the two-woman bobsled, was held in 2002. At the Winter Youth Olympic Games Lillehammer 2016, monobob had its Olympic debut. In the new solo discipline, athletes use a bob that is identical to those of all their competitors, giving pride of place to the driving, with the value of the equipment having no bearing. The womenâ€™s event is now on the programme of Beijing 2022.</p>
